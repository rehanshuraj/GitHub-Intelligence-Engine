explaination for task1:
    -routes/auth.js
       This file handles:
        Logging in with GitHub
        Getting permission
        Returning a safe token to frontend


        1.OAuth
        OAuth is like this:

            “Hey GitHub, can you allow my app to read this user’s repos?”
            GitHub: “Only if the user agrees.”
            User: “I agree.”
            GitHub: “Okay, here’s a key (token). Use it carefully.”

            That key = access token

         FLOW:
           - User logs in
           - GitHub approves
          -  Backend creates JWT
           - User is sent to frontend with token
           - Frontend stores JWT
           - Frontend sends JWT in API requests

        User clicks login
        ↓
        Backend redirects to GitHub
        ↓
        GitHub authenticates user
        ↓
        GitHub sends code
        ↓
        Backend exchanges code for token
        ↓
        Backend wraps token in JWT
        ↓
        Frontend uses JWT to request analysis

###
STATIC CODE COMPLEXITY USING AST(Abstract Syntax Tree)
We will compute REAL engineering signals:

1️⃣ Function length
2️⃣ Cyclomatic complexity
3️⃣ Nesting depth
4️⃣ God functions
5️⃣ Maintainability signals

Dependencies :-npm install @babel/parser @babel/traverse fs path
@babel/parser → converts JS → AST
@babel/traverse → walks through AST

    └── codeAnalysis.service.js FILE → TEXT → AST → FUNCTION NODES → METRICS


    utils/
    └── complexityCalculator.js
    This file teaches the computer:
    how many decisions exist
    how deep logic is buried
    how large a function is
    whether it’s becoming dangerous

###
Risky Coding Pattern Detector
  Because:
   - Bugs hide in them
    -Security breaches start here
   - Maintenance becomes hell
   - Juniors write them unconsciously
   - Seniors actively avoid the
   - This is engineering maturity, not syntax.

utils/
 └── riskDetector.js

This file:
    looks at ONE function
    reports risky patterns

###
FULL-EMS (Engineering Maturity Score)
GitHub shows:

stars ⭐
followers 👥
commits 📈

But companies want:
Can this person write maintainable code?
Do they refactor or just pile up logic?
Do they write safe, disciplined code?
Are they consistent over time?

So we create EMS = Engineering Maturity Score (0–100)
EMS answers:
“How mature is this engineer’s thinking in code?”
What inputs does EMS need?
    -Commit Quality Score (0–20)
    - Code Complexity Metrics
        cyclomatic complexity
        nesting depth
        god functions
    -Risky Coding Patterns
        secrets
        empty catch
        globals
    -Consistency
        steady commits
        no massive spikes
    -Refactor Signals
        refactor commits exist
    EMS is just combining intelligence, not magic.

EMS Philosophy (VERY IMPORTANT)
    We do NOT reward:
    ❌ more commits
    ❌ more repos
    ❌ more LOC
    We reward:
    ✅ discipline
    ✅ simplicity
    ✅ improvement over time
    ✅ safety
    That’s why weights matter.
